# Goals for Lab 01

- Get your feet wet!
- Innoculate you against `ggplot2` errors- we all get them!
- Get exposed to the *range* of things you can do, before we go **deeep**...
- Develop your *own* **personal** preferences for data visualizations!
    - Do you like or hate gridlines?
    - What fonts do you find pleasant to read?
    - What kinds of colors do you like?
    - Are you team `theme_gray` or `theme_bw` (or `theme_minimal`)?
